# Building Scalable React Applications with Modern Architecture

React has evolved significantly since its inception, and so have the patterns and practices for building scalable applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore modern architectural patterns that help you build React applications that can grow with your team and requirements.

## The Foundation: Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is the cornerstone of any scalable application. Here's a proven structure that works well for large React applications:

\`\`\`
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── forms/        # Form-specific components
│   └── layout/       # Layout components
├── features/         # Feature-based organization
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── profile/
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
├── services/         # API calls and external services
├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── stores/           # State management
\`\`\`

## State Management at Scale

When building large applications, choosing the right state management solution is crucial. Here are some modern approaches:

### 1. Zustand for Simple State

\`\`\`typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface UserState {
  user: User | null;
  setUser: (user: User) => void;
  logout: () => void;
}

export const useUserStore = create<UserState>((set) => ({
  user: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
  logout: () => set({ user: null }),
}));
\`\`\`

### 2. React Query for Server State

React Query (now TanStack Query) is excellent for managing server state:

\`\`\`typescript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const useUserProfile = (userId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['user', userId],
    queryFn: () => fetchUserProfile(userId),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
};
\`\`\`

## Component Patterns for Scale

### 1. Compound Components

This pattern is great for creating flexible, reusable components:

\`\`\`typescript
const Modal = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return <div className="modal" {...props}>{children}</div>;
};

Modal.Header = ({ children }) => <div className="modal-header">{children}</div>;
Modal.Body = ({ children }) => <div className="modal-body">{children}</div>;
Modal.Footer = ({ children }) => <div className="modal-footer">{children}</div>;

// Usage
<Modal>
  <Modal.Header>Title</Modal.Header>
  <Modal.Body>Content</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer>Actions</Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
\`\`\`

### 2. Render Props and Custom Hooks

Extract logic into custom hooks for better reusability:

\`\`\`typescript
const useToggle = (initialValue = false) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  
  const toggle = useCallback(() => setValue(v => !v), []);
  const setTrue = useCallback(() => setValue(true), []);
  const setFalse = useCallback(() => setValue(false), []);
  
  return { value, toggle, setTrue, setFalse };
};
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Code Splitting

Implement route-based code splitting:

\`\`\`typescript
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dashboard />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Memoization

Use React.memo and useMemo strategically:

\`\`\`typescript
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data, onAction }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.map(item => ({ ...item, processed: true }));
  }, [data]);
  
  return <div>{/* render processed data */}</div>;
});
\`\`\`

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows

\`\`\`typescript
// Example unit test
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { UserProfile } from './UserProfile';

test('displays user name', () => {
  const user = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
  render(<UserProfile user={user} />);
  
  expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Building scalable React applications requires careful planning and the right architectural decisions. By following these patterns and practices, you'll create applications that are maintainable, performant, and ready to grow with your needs.

Remember, architecture is not about using every new pattern or library—it's about choosing the right tools for your specific use case and team.
